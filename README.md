## Setup

### Server

To browse the examples from a locally run webserver (necessary for some samples), do
`npm install` from the project directory, and then `npm run start`. You can then
browse to http://localhost:3000.

---

### ESLint

To use eslint while viewing code, make sure to install it and the vscode
extension for it. Install eslint globally with `npm install -g eslint` and
then install the vscode extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint).

To setup eslint for js files you open outside this project, find your home
directory with `cd ~`. In that folder, add a copy of `.eslintrc.json`.

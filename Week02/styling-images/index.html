      Until recently, the prevailing view assumed lorem ipsum was born as a
      nonsense text. “It's not Latin, though it looks like it, and it actually
      says nothing,” Before & After magazine answered a curious reader, “Its
      ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency with which letters occur in
      English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty real.” As Cicero would
      put it, “Um, not so fast.”

    <figure class="image-box">
      <div class="image-frame">
        <img src="images/giraffe.jpg" alt="A giraffe!" title="A giraffe" />
      </div>
      <figcaption class="image-caption">A giraffe</figcaption>
    </figure>

      The placeholder text, beginning with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet,
      consectetur adipiscing elit”, looks like Latin because in its youth,
      centuries ago, it was Latin. Richard McClintock, a Latin scholar from
      Hampden-Sydney College, is credited with discovering the source behind the
      ubiquitous filler text. In seeing a sample of lorem ipsum, his interest
      was piqued by consectetur—a genuine, albeit rare, Latin word. Consulting a
      Latin dictionary led McClintock to a passage from De Finibus Bonorum et
      Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”), a first-century B.C. text
      from the Roman philosopher Cicero.

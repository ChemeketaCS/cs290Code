    <h1>Positioning</h1>

    <p>
      I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on
      new lines below me.
    </p>

    <p style="background: lightsalmon; position: sticky; top: 0">
      I am sticky!!! I will stick to the top of the screen as you scroll.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on
      new lines below me.
    </p>

    <div class="container">
      <p class="positioned">
        By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and our are
        as tall as our child content. Our total width and height is our content
        + padding + border width/height.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are
        separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit
      on the same line as one another, and adjacent text nodes, if there is
      space on the same line. Overflowing inline elements
      <span
        >wrap onto a new line if possible â€” like this one containing text</span
      >, or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do:
      <img src="long.jpg" />
